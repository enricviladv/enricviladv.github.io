Welcome to my website. My name is Enric Vila-Villasante and I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Utrecht University. My research interests revolve around the areas of **Education**, **Labour**, and **Development Economics**.

I am especially interested in the **process of human capital formation**. In my current research, I use field experiments and survey data to explore the drivers of human capital accumulation in low- and middle-income countries.
