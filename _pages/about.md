Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Enric Vila-Villasante and I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Utrecht University. I am an applied microeconomist interested in the process of human capital formation in both high- and low-income countries. In my current research, I use field experiments and survey data to explore the drivers of human capital accumulation in low- and middle-income countries.
